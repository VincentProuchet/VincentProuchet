- 👋 Hi, I’m @VincentProuchet
- 👀 I’m interested in web technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning how to use Symfony because I need it to create a portofolio
- Mainly because I can afford to pay for hosting service and the only free one I have use aan outdated Php
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now, but I would appreciate and consider any proposal
- 📫 How to reach me well you can use github for now.
